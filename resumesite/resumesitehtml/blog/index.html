  <h3>Thursday, 8th of September</h3>
    <p>It's been quite some time since my last blog, back at the beginning of my journalism career.<br><br> 
      Now I found myself neither gainfully employed as a member of the press nor in the manufacturing field I followed it into. And yet, here I am, more excited for the future than I have ever been. So what exactly am I so excited about? Before I start, I'd like to acknowledge I will be breaking the cardinal rule of journalism: never, EVER put yourself in the story. However, not only am I allowing myself to ignore my training - but in this era of personal branding - it is encouraged. I can BE the story.<br><br> 
      So then, what is my story?<br><br></p>
      <span class="headline hl5">MAN TAKES LEAP OF FAITH INTO CLOUD</span><br><br> 
      <p>There are many ways to follow this headline. The truest account - and please respect what remains of my journalistic integrity - goes something like this.<br><br> 
      I've always harboured an interest in computers so when the Digital Jobs Program came on my radar I jumped at the opportunity - even though I was employed at the time as an assistant manager at a manufacturing company. I choose the AWS Re/Start course because it covered a wide variety of topics and would provide a decent foundation for a career change. I didn't know much about cloud computing but the syllabus really appealed to me and I was ready to give it my all.<br><br> 
      During my course I was struck by overwhelming enthusiasm for my studies and I wanted to take every opportunity put this learning into practice. I then came across Forest Brazeal's 'Cloud Resume Challenge' which is touted as the ultimate test for anyone looking to get into a cloud career. The premise of the project is simple - host your resume in the cloud. There are, however, several conditions.<br><br> 
      1. Get an AWS certification<br>
      2. Write the resume in HTML & styled with CSS<br>
      3. Deploy as an Amazon S3 Static website<br>
      4. Use a custom DNS Domain name with HTTPS security<br>
      5. Include a visitor counter made from Javascript, DynamoDB, API Gateways and Lambda functions (written in Python)<br>
      6. Python tests for Lambda<br>
      7. Deploy all resources via a Serverless Application Model (SAM) template instead of using the console!<br>
      8. Use Github as source control, and Github Actions for CI/CD<br><br>
      Needless to say, I had never done anything like this before. It was a huge challenge, and took me several weeks alongside my coursework. There where many evenings when I had no clue how to tackle the next step. But with a little bit of research and a lot of head-scratching, I'm happy to report I overcame the challenge!</p>
      <img src="images/architecture.png" alt="Certified Cloud Practioner Badge" class="architecture"><br>
      <p>I made this diagram showing my architecture and you can see the finished project <a href="/">here</a>. It was such a rewarding experience and my confidence in my practical skills has skyrocketed.<br><br> 
      If you've made it this far - I highly recommend the challenge if you're looking to test your skills! There's a supportive community and a plethora of learning materials available at the <a href="cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>. Finally, I'd like to thank Forest Brazeal and the CRC community for their efforts in making the cloud accessible to all.<br><br>
