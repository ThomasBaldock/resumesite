<P class="blocktext">An ambitious and passionate AWS re/Start program learner – working towards my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner badge (Aug 11). Restarting career after 4 years in sales and business management at a manufacturing company. Finally matching a lifelong passion for technology and learning with career goals.</p>
<P class="blocktext">Looking to enhance my knowledge and utilise all my skills in my career with a positive and growth mindset.</p>
  <h3>Achievements and Projects</h3>
  <hr>
  <ul>
<li> Selected from over a thousand applicants for the Victorian Digital Jobs Program after several rounds of interviews and psychometric testing which lead to current AWS Re/Start course.</li>
    <li>Recruited as Player-Coach for a cricket club in the Netherlands, leading six sides and honing leadership, communication and teamwork skills.</li>
<li>In 9 weeks I’ve gone from zero cloud and programming knowledge to leading my class (top 3 out of 25 in weekly quizzes for past 3 weeks) among peers who have mostly all studied computer science. </li>
  <li>In same period I undertook the ‘Cloud Resume Challenge’ - separate from coursework - in order to build skills and understanding of Continuous Improvement / Continuous Development, Infrastructure as Code and well-architected principles.</li>
<li>Utilised AWS SAM for entire deployment, configuring Github, OpenID Connect Identity Provider, S3 buckets, DynamoDB, Lambda and an API gateway, all integrated with a Cloudflare domain, to ensure low latency, secure and tested deployment of my resume website.</li>
<li>In course we have covered AWS services, the management console, best practices and the shared responsibility model as well as foundations in: Linux, Networking, Security, Python and Databases.</li>
<li> Modernised the website for previous company without prior experience.</li>
    <li>For same company, I lead the transition from traditional manufacturing processes to those recommended by auditor SAI Global which lead to achieving the ‘5 Ticks StandardsMark’ Quality ISO 9001 certification, and was estimated to eliminate fabrications errors by over 40%, saving over $10,000 per month.</li>
<li>Also created a digital inventory database system with no prior experience to replace what was a paper- based system. This provided data analytics which calculated the average quantities of material used per day which halved the frequency of deliveries, minimising the disruptive task of loading tonnes of steel into racking. </li>
  <li>In an application for an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation role - after rigorous application process - was flown interstate for final round of interviews and was among top 30 from over 10,000 applicants.</li>
<li>I have been attending Australian Computer Society hackathons, AWS Melb User Group Meetings and other networking events in order to learn as much about the cloud computing community as possible.</li>
