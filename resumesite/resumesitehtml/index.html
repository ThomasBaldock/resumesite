          <p>&#8226; Selected from over a thousand applicants for the Victorian Digital Jobs Program after several rounds of interviews and psychometric testing which lead to current AWS Re/Start course.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; Recruited as Player-Coach for a cricket club in the Netherlands, leading six sides and honing leadership, communication and teamwork skills.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; In 9 weeks I've gone from zero cloud and programming knowledge to leading my class (top 3 out of 25 in weekly quizzes for past 3 weeks) among peers who have mostly all studied computer science.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; In same period I undertook the 'Cloud Resume Challenge' - separate from coursework - in order to build skills and understanding of Continuous Improvement / Continuous Development, Infrastructure as Code and well-architected principles.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; Utilised AWS SAM for entire deployment, configuring Github, OpenID Connect Identity Provider, S3 buckets, DynamoDB, Lambda and an API gateway, all integrated with a Cloudflare domain, to ensure low latency, secure and tested deployment of my resume website.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; In course we have covered AWS services, the management console, best practices and the shared responsibility model as well as foundations in: Linux, Networking, Security, Python and Databases.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; Modernised the website for previous company without prior experience.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; For same company, I lead the transition from traditional manufacturing processes to those recommended by auditor SAI Global which lead to achieving the '5 Ticks StandardsMark' Quality ISO 9001 certification, and was estimated to eliminate fabrications errors by over 40%, saving over $10,000 per month.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; Also created a digital inventory database system with no prior experience to replace what was a paper- based system. This provided data analytics which calculated the average quantities of material used per day which halved the frequency of deliveries, minimising the disruptive task of loading tonnes of steel into racking.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; In an application for an Australian Security Intelligence Organisation role - after rigorous application process - was flown interstate for final round of interviews and was among top 30 from over 10,000 applicants.</p><br>
          <p>&#8226; I have been attending Australian Computer Society hackathons, AWS Melb User Group Meetings and other networking events in order to learn as much about the cloud computing community as possible.</p>

    <p>To Whom It May Concern,<br><br>

      I have had the pleasure of knowing Thomas (Tom) Baldock both
      personally and professionally for 18 years. From junior cricket teams to
      working together in later years.<br><br>
      An accomplished cricketer and coach, Tom has always displayed a keen
      enthusiasm to help others around him in his sporting career.<br><br>
      Working together by accident many years later he has displayed not only
      the same attributes I saw as a junior but a fantastic work ethic. The
      ability to communicate with many different personalities shows some
      real skill. Tom will always listen and take on board advice given to him
      and ask questions to get to the correct outcome.<br><br>
      He has been fantastic in gaining skills that some only acquire after many
      years in an industry, and that comes from a keen desire to learn and
      adapt. The way he can think and plan his way through challenges is
      impressive.<br><br>
      A very social guy, his personality is always positive, engaging and fun.
      I am sure that Tom will fit in and add value to any opportunity given him
      in his working life. He is a delightful young man.<br><br>
